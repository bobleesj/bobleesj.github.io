Guide for decision making 
-------------------------

We want to believe we make a decision based on based on the given problem and proposed solutions. However, we are shaped by what I refer to as genetic inertia. From the genetic materials passed from our ancestors over hundreds of thousands of years, we have adopted favorable behaviors for survival.

- **The first behavior is to conserve energy**. The size of the human brain reflects this tradeoff. Neanderthals had slightly larger average brain sizes, around 1400 to 1500 cubic centimeters, compared to 1350. Evolution may have favored a more efficient brain that required less energy. The *Science* paper  says, we pack 86 billion neurons, three times more than those of our primate cousins.

- **The second behavior is to be a part of the community.** Early humans survived better when they worked together. Hunting, gathering, protecting one another, and caring for the injured all required collaboration, as demonstrated in team sports and strategic military operations.

- **The third behavior is the to avoid immediate pain**. Humans developed a strong drive to stay away from disease, predators, threats, dangerous organic matters. This tendency helped us survive in a world full of physical risks. Limited storage and the shorter life expectation made a long-term thinking a luxury. 

Human life in the twenty-first century is very different. Energy is more abundant than ever before. Careers today require the abiwity to persist through discomfort. Doing homework, preparing for exams, or working long hours, submitting a manuscript requires a long-term sustain effort that was considered a luxury before the agricultural revolution which has been known to occur about 10,000 B.C., a small portion of the 300,000 years of ago published in *Nature* from the pan-African origin of *Homo sapiens* :cite:`nature-homo-sapiens`. Avoiding that short-term discomfort, such as through procrastination, can damage long-term outcomes. We also live in relatively safe environments. Instead of fearing wild animals or dangerous terrain while sleeping, we instead fear for tomorrow's exams and work and the number of “likes” of a  social media post the next, which has much less threat on the lives on the people. Thrid, Creative work often requires extended time alone with a subject. While collaboration remains important, deep individual focus is now just as necessary. Constant social interaction, especially on digital platforms, can break that focus and make thoughtful work harder to achieve.

Many of the instincts that once ensured our survival may now interfere with good decision-making. That is why it is important to identify and understand them. By becoming more aware of when these old tendencies influence our thinking, we can make better choices in modern life.

**Core principles**

We behave what allowed us to survive and reproduce during the lifetime of our ancestors *Homo sapiens which are known 300,000 years ago.*

1. We want to **minimize energy usage**
2. We want to **avoid pain**.
3. We want to be **accepted by others**.

**Minimize energy usage and cognitive overload**

- We tend to overestimate the likelihood of negative events. It is better to be paranoid for survival. The phrase “winter is coming” prepares us for the future.
- First impression matters because it will determine one’s flight or flight response.
- We use the first information we receive. `anchording` occurs. This is because it costs more energy to constantly reevalute our brain in each situation. Therefore, we go about the day from the first information we encounter and the rest is adjusted baesd on that.
- We tend to remember the peak and the end of an experience rather than the whole experience. Patients recall the process was painful when the end of the process was painful. This is known as the `Peak-end effect` .
- It is easier to **look for evidence that supports our beliefs** than to look for evidence that contradicts them and feel uncomfortable. This is commonly referred to as  `Commitement bias`.
- We tend to have positive judgments about objects that they think are reliable in light of their experiences, regardless of logic and validity. This is called the Belief bias. (**信念偏向)**
- Survivalship bias - engineers during WWI tried to improve the survivability of planes by reinforcing the areas that were hit the most. However, they did not realize that the planes that were hit in those areas did not return, so they should have reinforced the areas that were not hit.
- **Declinism -** We see the past better than the future. The past doesn’t affect us. The future can kill us anytime. it’s important to be negative and prepare what’s to come.

**Accepted by others**

Our lives begin by being cradle by another human being. A newborn must be loved and raised by another human being. In wars between tribes, choosing the side increaess the chance of survival, rather than being defending alone. It is important be accepted by others.

- `Selective perpection` refers to seeing what we expected to see. In a single game, a fan would see more fouls from the other team. During a politica debate, one would see more faults from the other candiate based on the viwer's political affiliation. Hence, `the badnwagen effect` also occurs because following the crowd, rather than being one being correct, may increase the chance of survival.

**Avoid pain**

We want to avoid pain from diseases, natural disastrous, and potential attack by animals and other human begins. Pain is associated with danger and potentially death. We have a shock.

- We tend to consider our past as more positive as it was. We tned to consider the future as more negative than it is. The past is certain and the future is uncertain.
- We tend to assocaite patterns with random events. We have the desire to reduce the pain of uncertainty. This is the source of the `clustering illusion` . The product in the middle displayed often have the highest sales.
- We tend to form a greater after we do a favor for the person. It is also known as the `Benjamin Franklin` effect. The reason is that our brain attempts to rationalize that the time spent for the person isn't wasted. `Cognitive dissonance` we want to reduce it, our feeling and action do not match. Since action is already done, we change the way we think about the other person that the person must be good.
- We tend to support one's choice which were not considered at the time of the choice. This effect is known as `Choice-supportive bias` . It could be nost just based on `Cognitive Dissonance` where action and thought. It is may be also due to memory decay.

**Other biases that are combined.**

- We tend to remember their correct views and forget the errors. We want to avoid pain and discomfort in our memory.
- Why do we like to buy things in a bundle because buying each indvidiual, we want to avoid the fear of the thought of the money not being spent well.
- We tend to think that a combination of events (a conjunction) is more likely to occur than one or both of the individual events alone. So, it's better to provide more context for the reader. “Our app helps busy professionals save time by automating emails and scheduling, so you can reclaim 2 hours of your day” is better than “Our app helps you save time”. We humans didn't need formal probability. We needed an accessible real-life scenario just than a number. It is another reason we are drawn to a particulalry story rather than just a number. So our brain considers this vividness and more plausible and thus likelyhood. We are better of surviving not recalling probabiltiy but rather having the speicifc shape, structure, and methods for survival.

**Cognitive biases**

Recognizing human biases is important in understanding ourselves. We want to right the right decision, not hundred by our biases as much as we can. The goal isn't to remove them but to work with them. Not trying to correct but slowly correct determine and find so that we can make good decision as an organization.

**Confirmation bias -** We tend to see and hear what we want to hear. When we argue, we often try to look for the specific information. It is a shortcut when processing information. It's much easier. No one wants to be wrong.

**Commitment bias -** 

**Overvalue - We tend to value our own work because we want to avoid the unpleasant feeling that our time might have been not used well.** Hence, it's important to recognize that no one's time is wasted.  People who made their origam valued 5 times more than other's valuation. We irrationally value our efforts. So when someone creates an issue or pull request, it's important to acknowledge their effort so that we value their effort. This is the IKEA effect. We want users to love the product because they have invested their time and thus capture the increased perceived value associated with the product. We constantly fear that we don't hunt, our time is wasted. 

Our decision making will be progressively lower at the end of the day. Be aware that the decision isn't made by the end of the day. Have a full night sleep before. 

**Decoy is an option** 

$3, the medium is $6.50, and the large is $7. The second is a decoy. The decoy option isn't meant to be chosen at all. It feel like a better deal since there is barely any difference between the medium and the large.

**Disposition effect**

Our tendency to sell winning investments too early while holding onto losing investments for too long.

**Sunk cost fallacy**

sunk costs are already lost costs. We will most likely feel guilty or regretful if we don't follow the plan. It's the same of commitment bias.

Commitment bias

We try to convince ourselves that we are rational beings.

**Priming**

An individual's exposure to a certain stimulus influences their response to a subsequent prompt, without any awareness of the connection. Our brain is maliable and constnatly trained. For example, “Bye-now” effect is when you see the word “Bye” at the end of the magazine, we are more likely to purchase a new product.
