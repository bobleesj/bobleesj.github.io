What's strain mapping?
----------------------

What's strain?
    The deformation of a material due to an applied stress. It can be expressed as a change in length per unit length, or as a change in angle between two lines.

Why existing literature on 4D-STEM strain mapping uses convergence angles 0.2–1 mrad?

Whats zone axis pattern?
    A zone axis pattern is a diffraction pattern that is obtained when the electron beam is aligned along a crystallographic axis of the sample.

Loretnz transmission electron microscopy?

What's off-aixs holography (OAH)?
    (AI) Off-axis holography is a technique that uses a reference beam to create an interference pattern with the sample beam. This allows for the reconstruction of the phase and amplitude of the sample wavefunction.

What's reverse-mode automatic differentiation? (RMAD) for phase retrieval?

What's electron ptychography iterative engine (ePIE) for phase retrieval?

Defects, interfaces, compelx architecture and weak electron signals are hidden by the projection of the 2D materials potential to 2D.

What's electron tomography?
Combine images from multiple angles of 2D projects to reconstruct 3D structure.

2009 Midgley and Dunin-Borkowski Nature Materials

    The first examples of 3D reconstruction using TEM were publisehd in 1968. X-ray tomographs can be produced with sub-100nm resolution, a 2D spatial resolution of ~15 nm using zone plates(?).

this allows one to recover
3D structural information with a depth resolution on the order of
a few nanometers 

The beneift of multislice electron ptychography

    https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/124/24/240601/3298202/Uncovering-the-three-dimensional-structure-of

    I like this paper because it shows a nice figure on multislice electron ptychography. Also Ophus is the last author.

What's the problem of HAADF in STEM?

    It says, has a nonlinear dependence on the atomic number of the species.

Why use dark-field imaging?


What's the challenge in multislice electron ptychography?

    The challenge is that the sample is not a simple phase object, and the exit wavefunction is not a simple product of the probe and transmission functions. This means that the reconstruction process is more complex, and requires more sophisticated algorithms.

How are the electrons generated and accelerated?
    The electrons are generated by a field emission gun, and accelerated to high energies (typically 200 keV) using a high-voltage power supply. The electrons are then focused into a beam using electromagnetic lenses.

How are the electrons focused?
    The electrons are focused using electromagnetic lenses, which use magnetic fields to bend the electron beam and focus it to a small spot size.

How do magnetic fields are produced?
    The magnetic fields are produced by passing an electric current through a coil of wire. The direction and strength of the magnetic field can be controlled by adjusting the current.

So magnetic fields are produced perpendicular to the beam direction?
    Yes, the magnetic fields are produced perpendicular to the beam direction, which allows for the focusing of the electron beam.

How do the beam get focused with the magnetic fields?
    The magnetic fields bend the electron beam, causing it to converge to a small spot size. The strength and direction of the magnetic field can be adjusted to control the focus of the beam.

Does it bend inwards?
    Yes, the magnetic fields bend the electron beam inwards, causing it to converge to a small spot size. The strength and direction of the magnetic field can be adjusted to control the focus of the beam.

What do objective lenses do and do they have the magnetic field?
    The objective lenses are used to focus the electron beam onto the sample, and they do have a magnetic field. The magnetic field is used to bend the electron beam and focus it to a small spot size.

Why do we use HAADF, ABF, and BF instead of just one?
    HAADF, ABF, and BF are all different imaging modes that provide different information about the sample. HAADF is sensitive to the atomic number of the sample, ABF is sensitive to the phase of the sample, and BF is sensitive to the amplitude of the sample. By using all three imaging modes, we can obtain a more complete picture of the sample's structure and properties.

Why is it that the HAADF, the higher angle one gives better information about atomic number?
    The HAADF detector collects electrons that have been scattered at high angles, which are more sensitive to the atomic number of the sample. This is due to the greater number of interactions between the incident electrons and the electrons in the sample.

What's EELS and XEDS?
    We can characterize the energy distribution of electrons after inelastic scattering using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), the energies of emitted X-rays using a method named X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS)

What's the HDF5 standard?

What's virtual imaging? (py4DSTEM)

    For every real-space pixel (x, y), sum the intensity from that region in the diffraction pattern (kx, ky), Assign that value to the virtual image at that pixel. If we you the small region in the 2D detector, then you are using BF.

What's Higher-order Laue zone (HOLZ)?

What's zone-axis?

What's strain mapping(py4DSTEM)?

What's radial distribution analysis(py4DSTEM)?

py4DSTEM dataset

    ``DataCube`` instances contain a 4D data array corresponding to the complete 4D-STEM dataset.

    ``DiffractionSlice`` and ``RealSlic`` instances contain one or more 2D arrays with shapes corresponding to that of diffraction space.

Subgroups:

``microscope`` - the accelerating voltage of the beam, the camera length, the convergence angle, and so forth

 ``sample`` - material imaged, synthesis information,
and any sample preparation
 
 ``user``

 ``calibration`` - the pixcel sizes, any additional calibration information like rotational offsets(?), diffraction shifts, and ellipitcal disroptions(?)

What's virtual bright-field image?

What's the importance of orientation mapping?
    Each diffraction pattern contains the information about the crystal orientation. Each atom's grain is lined up differently. Some are tilted.

What's the size of an electron probe?

    1-5 nanometers in diameter. It can go below 0.1 nm if needed. It can scan a few atoms to a few hundreds of atoms. 

What's a typical size of a gold nanoparticle?

    Usually 10 - 50 nm.

What's the typical scan size?

    20-100 nm for nanoparticles, 100-500 nm for polycrystalline materials, and 100 nm - 1 micron for semiconducts. Step size of 0.1 nm or 1 nm is fine.

Flat-field normalized?
    
    remove variation in the detector’s illumination across the field of view. For example, the beam is brighter in the center.

Hot/head pixel corrupted?

    some pixels show zero, hot pixels are too active, abnormally high even, even if they shlud’nt 

What's elastic known-on threshold?

    The minimum energy required to move an atom due to a colision with an incoming particl, like an electorn or ion.
