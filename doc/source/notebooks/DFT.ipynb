    "# Kohn-Sham DFT Equations for Density Functional Theory for Beginners\n",

    "Abstract - In 1965, Kohn and Sham developed a practical scheme for density functional theory (DFT), which remains widely used in chemistry and materials science simulations due to its excellent balance between computational complexity and accuracy in determining the ground-state energy. As a materials science and engineering student at Columbia University, I have employed DFT to conduct ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for geophysical materials under extreme pressures and temperatures. Therefore, I have always been keen to understand the underlying mechanisms of using the overall electron density, which simplifies the solution to Schroodinger equation. In this paper, I discuss the formalism, descriptions, and assumptions required to compute many-body problems. The notations, symbols, and derivations closely follow those found in the seminal 1964 [1] and 1965 [2] papers, as well as in Dr. Chris A. Marianetti’s lecture slides from the MSAE E4203 course at Columbia University.\n",

    "## I. INTRODUCTION\n",
    "In 1964, the theoretical framework of Density Functional Theory (DFT) was developed by Pierre Hohenberg and Walter Kohn. The paper was revolutionary because it introduced a new perspective to simplify solving the Schr̈odinger equation. Two theorems were proposed: First, the ground state properties of a many-body electron system are uniquely determined by the electron density alone as a function of position. This shift brought about a paradigm change from the existing wave-function-based methods for determining ground state properties. Second, it introduces an exact variational principle whereby the ground state energy is computed from the correct electron density. In other words, the energy can be calculated without knowing the wavefunction!\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the theoretical framework introduced by the 1964 paper, Kohn and Sham in 1965 introduced a set of effective single-particle equations. These equations are used to approximate the true many-body problem of an interacting inhomogeneous electron gas in a static potential $v(r)$. This practical scheme, introduced six decades ago, is still widely used in materials science for developing phase diagrams and phonon analysis. The reason lies in the computational efficiency in approximating the ground state energy. By positing the problem in terms of finding the electron density alone, the complexity of finding the ground state energy properties for an N-particle system is reduced. The electron density is a function of just **three spatial coordinates**, regardless of the number of electrons in the system. Let us now begin dissecting the formalism and all the approximations.\n",

However, its accuracy depends inherently on the approximations used for the exchange-correlation energy, which account for complicated, unaccounted electron-electron potential and kinetic energy. Despite its limitations, such as the overestimation of bonding characteristics by the Local Density Approximation (LDA), DFT remains a indispensable tool in the field of materials science and solid-state research, providing the quick and balanced approach required to study macroscopic systems otherwise not computationally feasible with existing wavefunction-based methods.\n"
