Apr 20, 2025 - Published SAF descriptors in *JACS*
^^^^^^

I generated 97 features with ``SAF`` for binary ``.cif`` files, which provided the unsupervised learning algorithm with data for crystal structure classification.

Jan 17, 2025 - Published SAF/CAF software in *Digital Discovery*
^^^^^^

I developed two Python packages, ``SAF`` and ``CAF``, designed for structure- and composition-based features from ``.cif`` files.

    - Paper: https://doi.org/10.1039/D4DD00332B
    - CAF: https://github.com/bobleesj/composition-analyzer-featurizer
    - SAF: https://github.com/bobleesj/structure-analyzer-featurizer

Dec 16, 2024 - Published thermoelectricin prediction in *ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces*
^^^^^^

I contributed to a publication discussing thermoelectric performance with ML methods.

  - Paper: https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c19149

Nov 15, 2024 - Published cifkit in *Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)*
^^^^^^

I developed a Python package called ``cifkit``. It makes coordination geometry and atomic site analysis simple. The algorithm developed in ``cifkit`` is used in ``SAF``.

    - Peer-review: https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/7205

Mar 5, 2024 - Published coordination environment software in *Journal of Alloys and Compounds*
^^^^^^

I developed Python software for coordination envionrment chracterization of RE23Co6.7In20.3 (RE = Gd–Tm, Lu)

    - Paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.173241
